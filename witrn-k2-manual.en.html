<h3 id="how-to-power-on">2.1 How to power on</h3>
<p>Both the left and right type-C connectors on the K2 can be used for supplying power. To power on and wake the screen, either connect a USB-C data cable to the device’s female port, or plug the K2’s built-in male connector into a power adapter.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Regardless of the type of cable (USB-A to USB-C, short A/C, or USB-C to USB-C, short C/C) it is recommended that the button <strong><code>+</code></strong> is long pressed while connecting the K2 to a power source. This activates power delivery (PD) mode of the K2.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipftalabua/WITRN-K2-Quick-Reference-Manual/refs/heads/main/pictures/how_to_open.png" alt="how_to_open"></p>
<p><strong>Remark:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The K2 official website provides another way to power on: Press <strong><code>OK</code></strong> to power on. However, this method has limitations and is generally not recommended.</p>
<p>When using the K2 as a charging monitor it does not need to be powered-on; it is enough to simply connect the devices. Powering it on may result in extremely slow charging and protocol errors may emerge; see <a href="#why-is-the-charging-power-very-low-after-connecting-the-k2">3.5 Why is the charging power very low after connecting the K2?</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="why-doesnt-the-screen-light-up-when-plugged-in">2.2 Why doesn’t the screen light up when plugged in?</h3>
<p>First, check if your data cable is plugged into a powered outlet.</p>
<p>Second, there is a chance that your charger only supplies power if the power delivery (PD) handshake has been performed. In that case, also connect a phone or another device to use the K2 as a pass-through meter<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5">5</a></sup>. If you want to use the K2 stand-alone, the following solution may work for you.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> The K2 uses an electronic switch. Press and hold <strong><code>+</code></strong> to activate power delivery (PD) 5V power supply; this will power on the device and light up the screen. For PD chargers it makes no difference whether pressing and holding <strong><code>+</code></strong> is performed before or after plugging the cable into the charger.</p>
<h3 id="screen-remains-dark-when-pressing-the-lightning-bolt-button-during-plug-in">2.3 Screen remains dark when pressing the lightning bolt button during plug-in</h3>
<p>Because the PD chip only connects to one set of the power pins in USB-C to USB-C (C/C) cables and C/C charging cables have two sets of power pins, there is a 50% chance that PD 5V cannot be activated.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Flip the charging cable at one end and repeat the power-on operation.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-the-screen-go-dark-when-the-phone-is-unplugged">2.4 Why does the screen go dark when the phone is unplugged?</h3>
<p>The K2 is a pass-through meter<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn5" id="fnref5:1">5</a></sup> by design. If the phone was previously charging using the PD protocol, unplugging the phone will interrupt communication. In this case, the PD charger will no longer supply power and the K2 will go dark.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Refer to the solution for <a href="#why-doesnt-the-screen-light-up-when-plugged-in">2.2 Why doesn’t the screen light up when plugged in?</a></p>
<h3 id="why-does-the-k2-display-k2-dfu">2.5 Why does the K2 display “K2 DFU”?</h3>
<p>The button <strong><code>-</code></strong> was pressed while powering on, thus entering DFU mode<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn6" id="fnref6">6</a></sup>.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Do not press the <code>-</code> button while powering on. Refer to <a href="#how-to-power-on">2.1 How to power on</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="with-no-device-plugged-in-why-is-the-power-value-non-zero">3.1 With no device plugged in, why is the power value non-zero?</h3>
<p>When the K2 is connected at its female connector it will monitor its own power consumption, resulting in a power value of approximately 0.3W.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Using the HID port or its male connector will prevent the K2 from monitoring its own power consumption.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-power-displayed-lower-than-the-chargers-nominal-value">3.2 Why is the power displayed lower than the charger’s nominal value?</h3>
<p>The charger’s nominal power value is its maximum power. The power actually delivered depends on how much power the attached device (e.g. phone) requests and its charging status. It is normal that the power displayed by the K2 is less than or equal to the charger’s nominal power value.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-first-screen-showing-multiple-power-values">3.3 Why is the first screen showing multiple power values?</h3>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipftalabua/WITRN-K2-Quick-Reference-Manual/refs/heads/main/pictures/P1_desc.png" alt="P1_desc"></p>
<p>A power value shown in the green box on the first screen is the maximum power as indicated by the PD power supply.</p>
<p>The power, voltage, and current values in the gray box at the bottom of the screen are either inferred from inductive monitoring (in case of PD power supplies) or are pseudo-values derived from the protocol (as it is the case for some proprietary protocols). They generally denote the maximum current and voltage values for the currently requested power level. The actual current and voltage readings in the center of the screen are also affected by cable voltage drop and the current state of the attached device (e.g. phone). Usually, the values displayed by the K2 should always be less than or equal to the requested values. However, for proprietary protocols there may be inference errors; this is a bug in the firmware of the K2 and will probably be fixed in a future firmware version.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-power-value-in-the-greengray-box-in-the-lower-right-corner-of-the-first-screen-different-from-the-power-supported-by-my-phone">3.4 Why is the power value in the green/gray box in the lower right corner of the first screen different from the power supported by my phone?</h3>
<p>The answer is the same as above, i.e. it is likely that a proprietary protocol is used and the displayed values are inferred. In this case, a future firmware version may address this issue.</p>
<p>Some protocols also involve communication pin issues. In this case, try flipping one end of the USB-C cable and try again.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-charging-power-very-low-after-connecting-the-k2">3.5 Why is the charging power very low after connecting the K2?</h3>
<p>If the device (e.g. phone) makes use of fast charging and it is almost fully charged, this is normal behaviour. Refer to <a href="#why-is-the-power-displayed-lower-than-the-chargers-nominal-value">3.2 Why is the power displayed lower than the charger’s nominal value?</a>.</p>
<p>If your device is capable of fast charging but fails activate it when the K2 is connected, then you probably first pressed and held the <strong><code>+</code></strong> button while connecting the K2 to the charging cable, and only after that you connected the K2 to the device/phone. In this case, the K2 is recognized as a device on its own, it does not fully act in pass-through mode. The charging adapter is communicating with the K2 and not the device/phone, causing the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Disconnect the K2 from the power supply, then connect it again without pressing any buttons. Wait for the device/phone and charging adapter to complete the handshake. If the handshake still fails, try disconnecting and reconnecting all cables.</p>

<h3 id="fast-charging-protocols">4.1 Fast charging protocols</h3>
<p>Due to various historical issues, different mobile phone/device manufacturers have different solutions for high-power charging, each solution being a protocol. Third-party charger manufacturers communicate with the mobile phone/device to determine which solution it uses, confirming the required protocol before supplying power. These protocols are not interoperable. If the fast charging protocol provided by the charger does not match the fast charging protocol supported by the mobile phone/device, only the standard voltage of 5V will be supplied.</p>
<h3 id="testing-fast-charging-protocols">4.2 Testing fast charging protocols</h3>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Do not connect a device at any stage of fast charging protocol detection or spoofing! Ignoring this warning may destroy the device! If you are an expert in this field and know exactly what you are doing, proceed.</p>
<p>Connect the components as shown in the diagram below and use the correct power-on method (see <a href="#how-to-power-on">2.1 How to power on</a>) to start the K2. Go to the Fourth screen and select the option <strong>Fast Charge</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipftalabua/WITRN-K2-Quick-Reference-Manual/refs/heads/main/pictures/ADFC_pic.png" alt="FClist"></p>
<p>There is an automatic protocol detection option and several fast charging protocol spoofing options. Selecting <strong>Automatic Protocol Detection</strong> will bring up a prompt.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipftalabua/WITRN-K2-Quick-Reference-Manual/refs/heads/main/pictures/ADFC.png" alt="ADFC"></p>
<p>The interface varies slightly between versions. Versions v2.9 and below can only be set to detect the virtual E-Marker<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7">7</a></sup>. To be able to change the E-Marker, go to <strong>Set -&gt; Virtual EMark</strong>. Versions v3.1 and above allow quick setting of the virtual E-Marker. Version v3.4 additionally adds a “PD speedup”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8">8</a></sup> switch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OFF:</strong> Indicates that virtual E-Mark data is not used.</li>
<li><strong>[inbuilt emark]:</strong> Indicates that the K2’s built-in default 240W (50V 5A PD3.1 EPR) virtual E-Mark data is used.</li>
<li><strong>[copied Emark *NG]:</strong> Indicates that copied E-Mark data is used. <strong>*NG indicates that no data has been copied</strong>, the absence of the NG characters indicates that data has been copied.</li>
</ul>
<p>The K2 also supports modifying virtual E-Markers by using the host software. Added E-Markers will also also be shown in this interface and can be selected. See <a href="#how-to-export-and-import-e-markers">6.4 How to export and import E-Markers</a> for details.</p>
<p>Now, what is the most appropriate E-Marker setting? If using the original data cable (see the <strong>Note</strong> text below), select OFF. If not using the original data cable or using a data cable without an E-Marker, select the virtual E-Marker and press <strong><code>OK</code></strong> to enter automatic detection. After several restarts, the detection ends when END is displayed in the upper right corner.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Although the K2 supports the virtual E-Marker<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn7" id="fnref7:1">7</a></sup>, the optimal detection method is to connect the K2 female connector using the official original data cable from the charger, or to connect the K2 male connector to the charger with the female connector inserted into the charger’s official original data cable <strong>with the other end loose</strong><sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9">9</a></sup> (used for the charger to detect the E-Marker of the data cable). The detected protocol is most accurate in this case (“PD speedup”<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8:1">8</a></sup> can be selected as needed). If you are not using the original data cable, or your data cable does not have an E-Marker, select the virtual E-Marker as needed. The automatic detection protocol cannot be powered by HID. In special cases such as a black screen or an infinitely rebooting charger or power bank, HID power can be used to complete the test. During the test, the K2 will <strong>reboot</strong>, which is normal. The automatic detection protocol, combined with custom cables and OFF mode, can also be used to detect whether a cable supports a certain protocol.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipftalabua/WITRN-K2-Quick-Reference-Manual/refs/heads/main/pictures/ADFC_result.png" alt="ADFC_result"></p>
<p>After detection of the E-Marker is finished, you can view a list of all protocols supported by the charger. If it supports PD, press <strong><code>OK</code></strong> to view the PDO list.</p>
<p>The lower left corner displays the currently used E-Marker. If it is OFF, it displays “Fast Charging Protocol Detection”.</p>
<p>For firmware versions 3.4 and above, the PD speedup<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn8" id="fnref8:2">8</a></sup> switch will be displayed as ON or OFF within the green box at the top.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The K2 auto-detection interface currently <strong>does not detect</strong> some modified charging protocols, only general-purpose charging protocols.</li>
<li>There are many types of modified charging protocols, see the following examples.</li>
<li><strong>OPPO:</strong>
<ul>
<li>OPPO’s outdated second-generation SVOOC (modified PPS) is <strong>not detected</strong>.</li>
<li>OPPO has now fully upgraded to the third-generation SVOOC (modified UFCS). The auto-detection interface does not detect these, but you can activate the third-generation SVOOC UFCS modification through the UFCS spoof menu.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Xiaomi:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Xiaomi’s 140W, 210W, and some 67W models are special MIPPS and <strong>are not detected</strong>.</li>
<li>Xiaomi MIPPS only detects standard 120W or lower Xiaomi MIPPS.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>VIVO:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The VFC protocol auto-detection menu can detect these.</li>
<li>Activating specific voltage and current can be done by entering the VFC spoof menu separately.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Huawei:</strong>
<ul>
<li>SCP: Currently, Huawei’s main fast charging protocol is called SCP. The automatic detection can detect it.</li>

<h3 id="spoofing-fast-charging-protocols">4.3 Spoofing fast charging protocols</h3>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Do not connect a device at any stage of fast charging protocol detection or spoofing! Ignoring this warning may destroy the device! If you are an expert in this field and know exactly what you are doing, proceed.</p>
<p>Selecting a fast charging protocol from the list of fast charging protocols will check whether the charging adapter supports that protocol. If that is the case, a spoofing screen is shown where voltage can be adjusted. If supported, also the current can be adjusted.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-the-screen-go-dark-when-testing-fast-charging-protocols">4.4 Why does the screen go dark when testing fast charging protocols?</h3>
<p>A wrong power-on method has been used. For example, using <strong><code>OK</code></strong> to power on will result in a black screen when testing any fast charging protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Pay attention to the power-on method. Refer to <a href="#how-to-power-on">2.1 How to power on</a> for more details.</p>
<h3 id="why-cant-i-connect-my-device-while-performing-protocol-detection">4.5 Why can’t I connect my device while performing protocol detection?</h3>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Do not connect a device at any stage of fast charging protocol detection or spoofing! Ignoring this warning may destroy the device! If you are an expert in this field and know exactly what you are doing, proceed.</p>
<p>During protocol detection the output will carry high voltages. There is a high probability that attached devices cannot handly (all of) these high voltages. Hence, both the attached device (e.g. phone) and the spoofing interface (charger, K2) will very likely be destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="can-high-power-fast-charging-be-forced-by-protocol-spoofing">4.6 Can high-power fast charging be forced by protocol spoofing?</h3>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Do not connect a device at any stage of fast charging protocol detection or spoofing! Ignoring this warning may destroy the device! If you are an expert in this field and know exactly what you are doing, proceed.</p>
<p><strong>No</strong>, charging usually requires a handshake. Forcing higher power modes will trigger device protection at best; at worst, it will destroy the device.</p>
<h3 id="can-the-charging-adapters-protocol-a-be-changed-to-protocol-b-by-protocol-spoofing">4.7 Can the charging adapter’s Protocol A be changed to Protocol B by protocol spoofing?</h3>
<p><strong>WARNING:</strong> Do not connect a device at any stage of fast charging protocol detection or spoofing! Ignoring this warning may destroy the device! If you are an expert in this field and know exactly what you are doing, proceed.</p>
<p><strong>No</strong>, with spoofing the K2 only changes voltage and current of the output, no protocol conversion is performed. Without a proper handshake between charger and device such spoofing will trigger device protection at best; at worst, it will destroy the device.</p>
<p>For protocol conversion a <strong>bridge cable</strong> is needed. Such a cable can for example be purchased on Taobao.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-detected-protocol-different-from-the-label-on-the-charger">4.8 Why is the detected protocol different from the label on the charger?</h3>
<p>If the K2 is not connected using the official charging cable from the charger, or if the virtual E-Marker is not enabled, the K2 will not be able to detect fast charging protocols above 3A. In this case, the detected protocol will be inconsistent with the charger label. Also, the handshake protocol actually used to charge the device with this charging cable will be consistent with the one detected by the K2, meaning that fast charging will not be used.</p>
<p><strong>Solution:</strong> Use the charger’s original charging cable or a charging cable that the charger can recognize.</p>
<h3 id="why-is-the-protocol-displayed-in-the-lower-right-corner-of-the-first-screen-different-from-the-actual-protocol-on-the-phone">4.9 Why is the protocol displayed in the lower right corner of the first screen different from the actual protocol on the phone?</h3>
<p>The lower right corner of the first screen displays values from monitoring the power delivery (PD) handshake or pseudo-values from protocol inference, the latter of which may be incorrect. In this case, a future firmware update may address this issue.</p>
<p>Some protocols also involve communication pin issues. In this case, try flipping one end of the USB-C cable and try again.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-pd-speedup">4.10 What is “PD speedup”?</h3>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The official documentation lacks a good definition for “PD speedup”. Hence, its explanation in this manual is solely based on some test results.</p>
<p>The PD speedup switch is an option in firmware version 3.4 and above. Versions below 3.4 enable PD speedup by default. The official manual says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“PD speedup” function: Please disable for regular charging adapters.</p>
<p>Enable for some Apple PD charging adapters (PD speedup is only required for some Apple chargers).</p>
<p>“PD speedup” is enabled for reading the serial number of some Apple PD charging adapters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Generally speaking, PD speedup is only used for automatic protocol detection and reading the PD power code for Apple chargers. However, tests suggest that some non-Apple chargers may also be affected. If you encounter problems with protocol detection in firmware version 3.4 or above, try enabling or disabling PD speedup and then try again.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-block-protocols">4.11 How to block protocols</h3>
<p>Starting from firmware version 3.1, the K2 supports D+D- blocking. This can be useful for blocking protocols such as UFCS and SCP (which make use of D+D-), thus prioritizing PPS.</p>
<p>Go to the Fourth screen -&gt; <strong>Set</strong> -&gt; <strong>Block D+D- lines</strong>, select to enable or disable. The setting will take effect immediately.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="introduction-to-e-markers">6.1 Introduction to E-Markers</h3>
<p>An E-Marker is a chip embedded in a USB Type-C cable, essentially an “electronic ID card” for the cable. It declares the cable’s capabilities (such as whether it supports high-speed transmission, maximum voltage and current, length, etc.) to the host and device, thereby ensuring the safety and compatibility of PD fast charging and data transmission. Cables without an E-Marker cannot support currents greater than 3A or high-speed modes.</p>
<p>Each manufacturer has its own E-Marker tag. Some fast charging protocols rely on E-Marker certification; without an E-Marker or with an incompatible E-Marker the handshake protocol cannot be established.</p>
<p>The K2 has a built-in virtual E-Marker, which can simulate the capabilities of an E-Marker to some extent, but it cannot completely replace an E-Marker. This is because some manufacturers’ E-Markers are encrypted, making it impossible for the virtual E-Marker to simulate them. Furthermore, some chargers have E-Marker reading capabilities exceeding the K2’s simulation capabilities, making them unrecognizable.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-inbuilt-emark">6.2 What is “inbuilt emark”?</h3>
<p>The K2 has a default 240W (50V 5A PD3.1 EPR) virtual E-Mark tag built-in.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-read-an-e-marker">6.3 How to read an E-Marker?</h3>
<p>The K2 has the ability to read and copy E-Markers. Connect the components as shown in the image below. Select Fourth screen -&gt; <strong>Tools</strong> -&gt; <strong>E-Marker</strong> to access the interface.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipftalabua/WITRN-K2-Quick-Reference-Manual/refs/heads/main/pictures/read_Emark.png" alt="read_Emark"></p>
<p>Plug the data cable into the Type-C female connector, leaving the other end loose<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#fn9" id="fnref9:1">9</a></sup>. This will allow you to read the E-Marker information.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipftalabua/WITRN-K2-Quick-Reference-Manual/refs/heads/main/pictures/Emark.png" alt="Emark"></p>
<p>E-Marker information does not represent the actual capabilities of the data cable, for the simple reason that E-Markers can be simulated.</p>
<p>Long-press <strong><code>OK</code></strong> on this screen to copy the current E-Marker information. The copied E-Marker is saved in “copied emark”. The K2 can only save one copied E-Marker at a time. If you want the K2 to carry multiple E-Markers, see <a href="#how-to-export-and-import-e-markers">6.4 How to export and import E-Markers</a>.</p>
